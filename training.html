                <p>"I started working with Ray when my twins were toddlers. I wanted to tone up and improve my core and
                    all prior attempts had fizzled out. Ray was exactly what I needed, he listened to my fitness goals
                    and gradually built up my fitness. Ray’s whole body approach to fitness was the perfect fit for me.
                    Whether in person or on Zoom Ray spots the tiniest flaw in your technique and it’s the small
                    adjustments he suggests that make each exercise all the more impactful. He has an excellent
                    knowledge of fitness and understanding of how to work with any injuries. When you think you’re about
                    to give up Ray manages to get that bit extra from you. I’ve never got so much from working out and I
                    have Ray to thank. I can’t recommend him highly enough."

                    <p>"I was a classic case. I’d always exercised - I’d done a couple of marathons, cycled a lot and a
                        bit of swimming. Despite that, weight had crept on over the years and I just bought larger
                        clothes in denial of my ever changing body shape. When I met Ray I was sceptical. I really
                        wanted to lose weight, tone up and change my body for the better but didn’t really believe it
                        was possible and thought I knew best. I can honestly say his training programmes were the best
                        thing that ever happened to me. I didn’t feel self-conscious, just motivated. He always knew
                        what to focus on and how best to get the maximum output from me - working core, strength,
                        mobility and cardio. Attention was given to improving my running technique and doing running
                        specific strength exercises. With his help I managed to slash my marathon PB by over 60 minutes
                        and also finish in the top 5 female runners in my first ultra. I lost in excess of 16kg and was
                        actually quite happy to get my new body out in a bikini. It wasn’t only physical results I saw
                        but also improved mental well-being - it definitely helped me get through the stressful demands
                        of my day job! I simply cannot rate Ray highly enough - he’s pretty rare in the training world
                        and if I could bottle up the Ray technique to sell it, I’d be a very a wealthy woman!

                <p>Despite this difficult year, challenged by the various Covid restrictions, keeping up with my
                    training remained fundamental, both as an outdoor athlete and as a person with disabilities. Ray
                    planned a series of TRX routines for me; recording customised demonstrative videos to enable me to
                    keep up with the intensity and regularity of my trainings. I liked that I could do the exercises in
                    the houses, in the garden or anywhere else! Ray helped me the keep the focus on core, shoulders, and
                    arms so not to loose the muscle tone in the key areas of my body. The result is that, as soon as I
                    can, I'll be able to escape outdoors again, and with little effort, so to get back into full form
                    onto my kayak adventures!

        <div>

            <p>After an inital consultation I meat my clients at a pre-booked time and location which could be their
                home, at their work or in a public outdoor space. Apart from these options I can deliver training
                sessions at <a href="https://www.clever-fit.com/de-CH/fitnessstudio/basel-cf/" target="_blank">Clever
                    Fit Basel.</a> It helps with the variety of training sessions to have some equipment at
                home but I have some portable equipment with me too. Apointments should be scheduled for 4-6 weeks on
                regular basis for the best results. I can meet you at the following locations:
            <ul>
                <li>Basel-Stadt</li>
                <li>Allschwil</li>
                <li>Binningen & Bottmingen</li>
